# Optimal-Subsidies-for-Carbon-Capture-A-Stackelberg-Game-Approach

Here we publish all of the code used in our analytical work and numerical cases study. For questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Please note that the code provided is "reasearch code" and as such is not as polished as production code may be. For questions about the code, using it, or general feedback please do not hesitate to reach out to the corresponding author (ccolombe@utexas.edu)

## Repository Sections:
* The respository is organized in the following sections:  
  * Analytical Work:  We have one section in which we have all of our Mathematica/Wolfram code used in the analytical analysis. We have some interactive plots you can play with and see hwo the values of certain paramters effect the optimal subsidy in real time.
  * Case Study:
      * Here we have two files. One with Mathematica code in which we did our intial case study work and a python script in which we generate some of our later work.
